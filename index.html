        <p>Coffee is one of the most traded commodities on the planet Earth,
         second only to petrolium. It is drank by millions per day, and has a
          vast culture, historical importance, and health benefits, too!</p>
        <a name="culture"><h2 class="center">Coffee Culture</h2></a>
        <p>In the United States, one can define coffee culture along many
          different aspects. One popular aspect is along the line between
          Starbucks and the non-Starbucks coffeehouses. This is because of a
          <em>fundamental</em> fissure in ideology. The non-Starbucks
          coffeehouses want to pull the purfect shot of espresso, and serve it
          in a manner that showcases the flavor of the beans and the expertise
          of the barista. Starbucks differs here because the recepies that
          their baristas follow are designed to be sweet and cover up the flavor
          of the beans. This is important because when a bean is grown and
          subsequently roasted, the flavor of the region is locked inside the
          bean, waiting to come out. And each regin has a different story to
          tell.</p>
          <p>Next I will talk about some commonly ordered types of beverages.</p>
